title: Open Science, Open Source
---

Last month, I began my adventures in open source software with Public Lab, ["a community and non-profit democratizing science to address environmental issues that affect people."](https://publiclab.org/about)  Curiously enough, my path to open source and this project in particular began (as with [my path to writing a blog](http://carolineho.me/blog/Hello-World/)) in an English class I took last year on Victorian science, literature, and society.  Learning about the scientific community in that era, I really resonated with the prevalent culture of citizen science â€“ a ubiquitous sentiment that anybody (including a certain [parson/amateur naturalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Darwin)) could contribute to furthering humanity's knowledge.  When I started participating in computer science and [hackathon communities](http://www.ladiesstormhackathons.org), I discovered open source, found the same spirit in it as citizen science, and knew it was something in which I wanted to get involved!

After reading [some](http://www.firsttimersonly.com) [helpful](http://readwrite.com/2014/10/10/open-source-diversity-how-to-contribute/) [articles](https://opensource.com/education/16/1/how-students-get-started-open-source) on getting started in open source, I decided to search through the ```first-timers-only``` label on Github to find an issue that would match my skillset while also providing a non-trivial challenge.  I found myself drawn to a particularly clear, well-documented issue in the familiar field of frontend web development: [making an answering form view mobile-responsive](https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/issues/681).  When I looked more closely at the repository and realized it was the wiki website of an active citizen science community, I eagerly volunteered my help!

Immediately after forking the repository and setting it up locally, I found myself thrown off by one detail I'd neglected to notice in the description of the website: it was built on Ruby on Rails.  Being unfamiliar with the framework at the time, I was initially bewildered and intimidated by the ```.erb``` endings to the files and the HTML code enclosed in ```<%= %>```'s.  However, after realizing the frontend code essentially remained the same, I quickly became acclimated to the code and made my first change, [ensuring that the answering container correctly displayed buttons within it](https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/issues/681#issuecomment-240616628).  Upon feedback from project admins, I worked to make the layout more elegant (for example, making profile images, comments, and buttons in line with each other), which I found more challenging than expected.  To accomplish this task, I researched CSS until I found the solution that would allow me to account for different screen sizes: [media queries](http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_mediaqueries.asp).  It felt very rewarding to learn something on my own and apply my new knowledge to a real problem!

Since then, I've worked on a few other issues, including [creating a compact display of barnstars on profile pages](https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/issues/705) and [adding Bootstrap tooltips with relevant information to research note tags](https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/issues/751).  Most recently, I tackled the meatier issue of [redesigning the Tools page to incorporate information on activities for users to participate in](https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/issues/765).  As the specific sub-problem of retrieving the number of activities and updates for a tool required more Ruby programming knowledge and a deeper understanding of the backend of the large codebase, I realized that trying to find the solution entirely by myself would be inefficient, and I ended up asking for help from a more experienced contributor.  With his clear breakdown of the problem and explanation of the existing code, I was able to figure out how to write the Ruby code on the backend necessary to display the information.  After including activity and update counts for each tool, I finished updating the overall design of the page by [standardizing image sizes with CSS, replacing the "Read more" link with a more engaging "Explore" button, and adding a helpful introduction to the tools for newcomers](https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/issues/765#issuecomment-246210737).  With its new information and user-friendly language and design, the page now encourages engagement in community DIY science projects.  The new page design was featured a couple days ago on the [Public Lab Twitter](https://twitter.com/PublicLab/status/778239629380157440), and I'm quite excited that my work will directly advance the lab's culture of citizen science!

I'm definitely planning to contribute to Public Lab in the long term - for my next steps, I plan to a) learn more about Ruby to better understand the backend (as of right now, I've completed a Codecademy course on the language and have a Ruby on Rails personal practice project in the works) and b) get involved in the actual environmental science activities!  Working on the project has been a fantastic learning experience thus far, and I'm sure it will continue to be so in the future.

And to any fellow programmers out there who are also passionate about citizen science, there's plenty of very well-documented and beginner-friendly [first-timers only issues](https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Afirst-timers-only) open in the Public Lab repository, so what are you waiting for?  Go for it, start contributing, and get ready to learn!
