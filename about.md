Hello there! I'm a member of the class of 2019 at Stanford University majoring in [Symbolic Systems](https://symsys.stanford.edu/ssp_description) (think computer science, linguistics, psychology, and philosophy) with a concentration in Artificial Intelligence. On campus, I'm involved in high school outreach for the [Girls Teaching Girls to Code](http://www.girlsteachinggirlstocode.org) leadership team, which entails organizing coding workshops and events at local schools. In my free time, I enjoy participating in hackathons, working on personal/open source projects (like [this one](https://github.com/publiclab/plots2)), having late-night conversations with friends, discovering new music/literature, and social dancing.
